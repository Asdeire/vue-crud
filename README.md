# Vue 3 CRUD Application

## Project Description

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Vue 3. The app interacts with a REST API to manage records, including functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records via HTTP requests.

The project uses the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), which provides mock data for testing and development.

## Key Features

- **Create**: Add a new record via a form.
- **Read**: Display a list of records from the API.
- **Update**: Edit an existing record using a form (inline or in a modal).
- **Delete**: Remove a record from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **Vue Router**: For routing between different views.
- **Axios** or **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to interact with the API.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the application.

## Features and Functionality

- **Data Binding**: Vueâ€™s one-way and two-way data binding is used to manage input fields and display data.
- **Computed Properties**: For efficient data manipulation and display.
- **Methods and Events**: To handle user interactions such as clicking buttons, form submissions, etc.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Vue directives such as `v-if` and `v-for` are used for conditional rendering and looping through records.
- **API Integration**: The application uses the Fetch API to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API.

## Example

- **Create**: A form allows users to create new records.
- **Update**: Users can click an "Edit" button to update an existing record.
- **Delete**: Each record has a "Delete" button to remove it from the list.
